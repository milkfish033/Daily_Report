***What does this project do***

>This project is an advanced automated reporting system designed for the efficient monitoring and management of a knowledge base (RAG, Retrieval-Augmented >Generation) system. It integrates seamlessly with a MySQL database to fetch, process, and analyze data on knowledge base entries, documents, and user >interactions. By calculating daily and cumulative metrics over the past seven days, the system generates comprehensive HTML reports featuring visual trend >analyses and key statistical summaries. These reports, complete with embedded graphs, provide actionable insights into the system's performance and user >engagement, thereby supporting data-driven decision-making and optimizing knowledge base management.

***What will it look like when sending the html file in email***

***Before you start***

***(i)Set up Virtual Environment***

***Why Virtual Environment***: 
Setting up a virtual environment in Python isolates project dependencies, ensuring that different projects can use different versions of the same libraries without conflicts. This isolation provides a consistent development environment, avoiding system-wide changes and simplifying dependency management.

>python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

***(ii)Set up Mysql***

>pip install mysql-connector-python

>pip install mysql-connector-python schedule matplotlib

***(iii)Set up matplotlib.pyplot***

Matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc

>pip install matplotlib
